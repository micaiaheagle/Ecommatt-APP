# Expansion Features: Poultry & Crop Farming

Based on industry standards and [FarmerERP Features](https://farmererp.com/features/), here are suggested modules to upgrade Ecomatt Farm.

## 🐔 Poultry Management Module
**Goal**: Manage both Broiler (meat) and Layer (eggs) operations.

### 1. Flock Management
-   **Batch/Flock Tracking**: unique IDs for each batch of birds.
-   **Daily Logs**: Track mortality, culls, and water consumption daily.
-   **Growth Tracking**: Weekly weight sampling to track Average Daily Gain (ADG) and Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR).

### 2. Egg Production (Layers)
-   **Daily Collection**: Record eggs collected (Good, Cracked, Broken).
-   **Laying Percentage**: Auto-calculate laying rate % based on flock size.
-   **Egg Grading**: Categorize by size (Small, Medium, Large, Jumbo).

### 3. Poultry Specialized Inventory
-   **Feed Types**: Starter, Grower, Finisher, Layer Mash.
-   **Medicine**: Vaccines (Newcastle, Gumboro) and antibiotics specific to poultry.

### 3a. Advanced Poultry Operations (NavFarm Inspired)
-   **Hatchery Management**: Monitor incubation and hatching results.
-   **Breeder Management**: Track parent stock performance and lineage.
-   **Contract Broiler Farming (CBF)**: Manage agreements if outsourcing significantly.
-   **Bird Grading**: Auto-categorize birds by weight class during sales.

## 🌽 Crop Farming Module (Maize, Beans, Vegetables)
**Goal**: Manage field lifecycles from preparation to harvest.

### 4. Field/Plot Management
-   **Field Mapping**: Define land areas (e.g., "Field A - Maize"). **New**: Visual overlays & crop assignment by soil type.
-   **Soil Sampling Logs**: Record soil test results (pH, Nitrogen, **EC levels**) to optimize fertilization.
-   **Fertility Mgmt**: AI-driven fertilizer recommendations based on soil data.
-   **Crop Cycles**: Track "Seasons" (e.g., Summer Maize 2025).

### 5. Activity Logging (The "Crop Calendar")
-   **Land Prep**: Ploughing, Discing, Fertilizing.
-   **Planting**: Date, Seed Variety, Rate (kg/ha).
-   **Maintenance**: Weeding, Spraying (Herbicides/Pesticides).
-   **Smart Irrigation**: Track water usage per field. **Feature**: Smart scheduling & dry zone alerts.
-   **Monitoring**: Scout for pests/diseases (e.g., Armyworm alerts).

### 6. Harvest & Yield
-   **Harvest Recording**: Date, Quantity (Tons/Kg/Crates), Quality check.
-   **Yield Analysis**: Calculate Yield per Hectare to compare field performance.
-   **Post-Harvest**: Storage tracking (Silos/Barns) and drying/processing logs.

## 🚜 General & Advanced Tech Upgrades

### 7. Machinery & Asset Management
-   **Vehicle Logs**: Tractors, Delivery Trucks usage hours.
-   **Maintenance Schedule**: Service reminders (Next Service: 5000km).
-   **Fuel Log**: Track diesel consumption per vehicle/activity.
-   **Smart Machine Management**: Future integration for mechanized assets.

### 8. Enhanced Financials (Cost Centers)
-   **Profit per Enterprise**: Distinct P&L for Piggery vs. Poultry vs. Crops.
-   **Input Cost Allocation**: Allocate Fertilizer cost specifically to "Field A" to calculate true Cost of Production.

### 9. Staff Labor Allocation
-   **Timesheets**: Record hours spent on specific activities (e.g., "6 hours Weeding Field B").
-   **Task Assignment**: Assign daily duties to specific workers via mobile view.

### 10. Future-Ready Features (Tech) & Compliance
-   **IoT Integration**: Temperature sensors for Broiler houses.
-   **Qr Code Traceability**: "Farm to Fork" tracking for sold produce.
-   **Compliance**: Auto-generate audit reports (FSSAI / GAP ready).
-   **Offline-First Mobile Mode**: Critical for rural usage (NavFarm feature).
-   **Multi-Location Dashboard**: Unified view if farm expands to multiple sites.
-   **IFRS Compliant Reports**: Standardized accounting for bank/audit readiness.

### 11. Localization & Accessibility (Sbali AI Inspired)
-   **Voice Assistant**: Speak to the app for logs/queries (English/Shona/Ndebele).
-   **SMS Fallback**: Receive critical alerts (e.g., weather, prices) via SMS if data is off.
-   **AI Disease Diagnosis**: Upload photo of crop leaf/pig skin for instant AI diagnosis.
-   **Market Linkage**: Real-time commodity prices (Market Data) to decide when to sell.

### 12. Crop Integration (Mixed Farming Future)
-   **Manure Management**: Track waste output from the piggery and schedule its application as fertilizer to specific crop fields.
-   **Feed Crop Planning**: If the farm grows its own maize/soya, link the harvest directly to the feed inventory.

### 13. Supply Chain & Logistics (High Value)
-   **Supplier Management Portal**: A module to track vendors (feed, meds, equipment), performance ratings, and purchase history.
-   **Harvest & Logistics Planner**: Tools to schedule transport for market-ready pigs, including route optimization and coordination with abattoirs.
-   **Inventory QR Scanning**: Use the camera to scan barcodes on feed bags or medicine bottles to instantly log stock usage or intake (beyond just animal tags).

### 14. Enhanced Biosecurity & Compliance
-   **Geofencing for Disease Control**: Use GPS to track movement between "Clean" and "Dirty" zones. Alert staff if they cross zones without logging a sanitation break.
-   **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated generation of government-compliant movement permits and veterinary health certificates.
-   **Environmental Monitoring Integration**: Connect to IoT sensors (temperature, humidity, ammonia levels) in the pens for real-time environmental alerts instead of manual checks.

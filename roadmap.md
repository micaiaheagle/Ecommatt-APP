# Strategic Roadmap: Ecommatt App v2.0 & Beyond

This roadmap outlines high-impact, strategic enhancements designed to build resilience, operational excellence, and economic stability for high-growth agricultural enterprises.

---

## 🧬 1. Biogenetic Lineage Explorer (The Family Tree)
**Objective**: Prevent inbreeding and identify "Super-Generative" bloodlines.
- **Visual Pedigree**: A recursive tree view showing the lineage of every sow and boar.
- **Performance Heatmap**: Overlay "Litter Size" and "Growth Rate" data onto the family tree to see which ancestors pass on the best traits.
- **Inbreeding Alerts**: Automated block/warning when attempting to mate pigs with close genetic overlap.

---

## ⚡ 2. Energy Resilience & Solar Dashboard
**Objective**: Ensure "Life Support" systems remain active during regional power outages (Load Shedding).
- **Inverter Integration**: Real-time monitoring of solar battery levels and inverter load.
- **Critical Run-Time Calculator**: AI-driven prediction: *"Current battery handles water pumps for 14 more hours at current consumption."*
- **Auto-Shedding Alerts**: Push notifications to staff to turn off non-essential equipment when battery hits critical thresholds.

---

## 🪙 3. Multi-Currency "Inflation Shield"
**Objective**: Maximize procurement value in volatile currency environments (ZiG/USD/ZAR).
- **Procurement Parity**: Live comparison of input costs (feed, meds) across different currencies from registered suppliers.
- **Settlement Advisor**: Suggests the optimal currency for payment today based on real-time exchange rate stability and vendor discounts.

---

## 🚑 4. Emergency "War Room" Button
**Objective**: Zero-latency response to critical farm threats.
- **One-Tap SOS**: A high-visibility button that sends GPS-tagged alerts to all staff, owners, and local veterinary/security services.
- **Threat Categories**: Fire, Water Burst, Intruder, or Disease Outbreak.
- **Incident Command**: Instantly opens a dedicated "War Room" chat and checklist for coordinated response.

---

## 🛡️ 5. Biosecurity "Contact Tracing"
**Objective**: Contain disease outbreaks by tracking internal movement.
- **Gate-Level Logging**: Use Bluetooth beacons or QR scans at every pen entry/exit.
- **Path of Infection Report**: If a pen flags a disease, instantly generate a report showing every staff member who visited that pen and where they went next.
- **Sanitation Verification**: Lock task completion until a "Sanitizer Station" scan is performed.

---

## 🌿 6. "Circular Farm" Waste-to-Wealth
**Objective**: Transform liabilities (manure/waste) into assets (energy/fertilizer).
- **Transformation Tracker**: Log the conversion of pig manure into Biogas or Organic Compost.
- **ESG/Green Dashboard**: Tracks "Carbon Offset" and "Water Efficiency" to qualify for international "Green Financing" and lower-interest agricultural loans.
- **Sustainability Certificates**: One-click generation of audit-ready environmental compliance docs.

---

## 📸 7. AI Body Condition (BCS) Scanner
**Objective**: Precision nutrition through visual health assessment.
- **Vision-Based Scoring**: Use the mobile camera to take a side-profile photo of a sow.
- **Automated Ration Adjustment**: A vision model scores the BCS (1-5) and automatically updates the pig's daily feed ration in the `Operations` module to reach the ideal score.
- **Posture & Gait Analysis**: Detect early signs of lameness or injury through video analysis.

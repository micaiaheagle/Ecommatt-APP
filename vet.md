## 1. INTRODUCTION

A piggery assessment was conducted at Muzorori Agribusiness on 6 December 2025 by Appropriate AgriTech Zimbabwe. The purpose of the visit was to:

- Assess the current pig herd structure
- Evaluate lactating sow performance and piglet survival
- Review weaner feeding practices
- Assess the farm’s readiness for the next production cycle
- Provide nutrition and management recommendations to improve productivity, reduce losses, and strengthen reproductive efficiency

All findings and recommendations are based on the on-site observations and pig feed formulations provided by the client.

## 2. CURRENT PIGGERY STATUS

### 2.1 Herd Summary

- **38 weaners**
  - 12 weaners (5 weeks old)
  - 26 weaners (4 weeks old)
- **11 lactating sows**, with litter sizes ranging from 8 to 17 piglets
- **3 open sows**
- **10 serviced sows**
- **1 boar**
- **10 open gilts** recently injected with Farrowsure (good for reproductive disease protection)

### 2.2 Piglet Mortality Analysis

Piglet losses were recorded as follows:

- Several piglets crushed (most common cause)
- Some born weak and later died
- Most crushing occurred in the first 4 days post-farrowing

### 2.3 Key Observations

- Sows are genetically good performers, producing 10–17 piglets per litter, which is excellent.
- Piglet losses are management-related, not genetic.
- Weaners were being overfed, leading to gut stress and poor feed efficiency.
- Farrowing pens lack adequate creep heat, rails, and controlled zones to prevent crushing.

---

## 3. WEANER FEEDING EVALUATION

### 3.1 Issue Observed

Weaners were receiving too much feed per day, exceeding their stomach capacity and causing:

- Scouring
- Bloating
- Poor feed conversion ratio (high cost of gain)
- Increased susceptibility to post-weaning stress

### 3.2 Corrective Feeding Recommendation

As agreed during the visit, feed each weaner **400 grams per day**, divided into four meals:

- 100 g at 8 am
- 100 g at 11 am
- 100 g at 2 pm
- 100 g at 4 pm

This regimen:

- Protects the developing gut
- Prevents diarrhoea
- Encourages uniform growth
- Reduces feed wastage
- Ensures smooth transition to grower feed at 10 weeks

This feeding level aligns with Appropriate AgriTech Zimbabwe’s creep & weaner feed standards.

## 4. NUTRITION GUIDELINES FOR ALL PIG CLASSES

### 4.1 Creep & Weaner Feed (0–10 weeks)

**Formulation Provided:**

- Maize – 540 kg
- Wheat bran – 130 kg
- Soybean meal – 298 kg
- Premix – 32 kg

**Feeding rate:**

- 400 g/day per piglet, split into 4 meals
- Increase gradually to 800 g/day at 8–10 weeks if growth is good

---

### 4.2 Grower Feed (10–16 weeks)

**Formulation:**

- Maize – 470 kg
- Wheat bran – 270 kg
- Soybean meal – 228 kg
- Premix – 32 kg

**Feeding rate:**

- Start at 1.5 kg/day per pig
- Increase to 2.2 kg/day as pigs approach 16 weeks

---

### 4.3 Finisher Feed (17+ weeks to slaughter)

**Formulation:**

- Maize – 500 kg
- Wheat bran – 300 kg
- Soybean meal – 168 kg
- Premix – 32 kg

**Feeding rate:**

- 2.5–3.0 kg/day per pig depending on slaughter target weight

---

### 4.4 Lactating Sows

**Recommended feed:** Lactating Sow Meal

**Formulation:**

- Maize – 520 kg
- Wheat bran – 250 kg
- Soybean meal – 198 kg
- Premix – 32 kg

**Feeding rate:**

- 2.0 kg/day for the sow
- 0.45 kg per piglet nursing

**Example:**  
Sow with 10 piglets → 2.0 + (10 × 0.45) = **6.5 kg/day**

This prevents:

- Sow aggression → reduced crushing
- Milk shortage → fewer weak piglets
- Post-weaning infertility

---

### 4.5 Dry / Open / Gestating Sows

**Feed:** Boar & Sow Meal

- Maize – 450 kg
- Wheat bran – 350 kg
- Soybean meal – 168 kg
- Premix – 32 kg

**Feeding rate:**

- 2.0–2.5 kg/day
- Increase to 2.5 kg/day during last 5 weeks before farrowing

---

### 4.6 Boar

**Feed:** Boar & Sow Meal

- 2.0–2.5 kg/day
- Maintain body condition score (BCS) 3–3.5
- Avoid obesity — reduces libido and semen quality

---

## 5. MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### 5.1 Reduce Piglet Crushing

Crushing accounted for most piglet losses.

**Recommended interventions:**

1. Install creep rails in all farrowing pens
2. Provide a heated creep area (heat lamp or heating pad)
3. Ensure sow receives correct feed to reduce agitation
4. Supervise farrowings closely, especially first 72 hours
5. Foster weak piglets early to stronger sows

---

### 5.2 Improve Farrowing Environment

- Use dry bedding
- Maintain temperature at 30–32°C for piglets
- Reduce drafts
- Clean pens daily

---

### 5.3 Strengthen Reproductive Management

- Maintain BCS of sows at 3.0 during breeding
- Gilts vaccinated with Farrowsure — good practice, continue annually
- Service sows 5–7 days post-weaning

---

## 6. OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### Strengths

- Excellent litter sizes (10–17 piglets)
- Large number of serviced sows → production pipeline strong
- Good feed ingredients available
- Correct formulations already established

### Challenges

- High crushing mortality
- Weaner overfeeding
- Lack of creep heat and rails
- Inconsistent lactation feeding levels

### Expected Improvements When Recommendations Are Implemented

- 40–60% reduction in piglet crushing
- Faster, uniform weaner growth
- Stronger sow body condition → shorter weaning-to-service interval
- Improved overall farm profitability

---

## 7. CONCLUSION

Muzorori Piggery has excellent production potential, supported by strong sow fertility and large litters. The main constraints are piglet survival, weaner feeding discipline, and lactating sow nutrition. Implementing the recommendations in this report will significantly improve output and reduce losses.

Appropriate AgriTech Zimbabwe remains available for:

- Follow-up monitoring
- Feed formulation supply
- Training of workers
- Farrowing management support
